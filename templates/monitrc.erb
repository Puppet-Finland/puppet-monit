# Mail queue; useful if for the (local) mail server is unresponsive for extended
# periods of time
set eventqueue
     basedir /var/monit  # set the base directory where events will be stored
     slots 100           # optionaly limit the queue size

# This is unnecessary piece of code if $fqdn is defined in the node definition
# (when it'd otherwise be missing) but very useful as an example:
# 
<% if @fqdn %>

# We don't want to receive monit instance change events, which are sent if monit
# restarts.
set alert <%= servermonitor %> but not on { instance } with reminder on 480 cycles

# Include monit rule fragments installed by services. We need this rather ugly 
# (Puppet) syntax if we isolate the variables into a separate subclass (e.g. 
# monit::params) and just include that subclass in the class that loads the 
# template.
include <%= scope['monit::params::fragment_dir'] %>/*.monit
