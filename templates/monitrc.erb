# How often to poll. Debian overrides this in /etc/default/monit
set daemon  180
set logfile syslog facility log_daemon                       
set mailserver localhost

# We need monit's httpd for monitoring status of services, enabling them after 
# unmonitoring, etc. A browser or the "monit" application can be used for the 
# job.
set httpd port 2812 and use the address localhost
    allow localhost

# Mail queue; useful if for the (local) mail server is unresponsive for extended
# periods of time
set eventqueue
     basedir /var/monit  # set the base directory where events will be stored
     slots 100           # optionaly limit the queue size

# This is unnecessary piece of code if $fqdn is defined in the node definition
# (when it'd otherwise be missing) but very useful as an example:
# 
<% if has_variable?("fqdn") then %>
set mail-format { from: monit@<%= fqdn %> }
<% else %>
set mail-format { from: monit@<%= hostname %> }
<% end %>

# We don't want to receive monit instance change events, which are sent if monit
# restarts.
set alert <%= servermonitor %> but not on { instance } with reminder on 480 cycles

# Include monit rule fragments installed by services. We need this rather ugly 
# (Puppet) syntax if we isolate the variables into a separate subclass (e.g. 
# monit::params) and just include that subclass in the class that loads the 
# template.
include <%= scope.lookupvar('monit::params::fragment_dir') %>/*.monit
