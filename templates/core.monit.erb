# This file contains generic system-wide things to monitor. This includes things 
# like CPU load, memory etc. Non-generic stuff should go to respective service 
# modules. For example, Apache module should contain monit scripts to monitor 
# Apache.

# CHECK SYSTEM <unique name>
#
# The system name is usualy hostname, but any descriptive name can be used. This 
# test allows to check general system resources such as CPU usage (percent of 
# time spent in user, system and wait), total memory usage or load average.

check system <%= @hostname %>
    if loadavg (1min) > <%= @loadavg_1min %> then alert
    if loadavg (5min) > <%= @loadavg_5min %> then alert
    if memory usage > <%= @memory_usage %> then alert
    if cpu usage (system) > <%= @cpu_usage_system %> then alert
    if cpu usage (user) > <%= @cpu_usage_user %> then alert

# CHECK FILESYSTEM <unique name> PATH <path>
#
# <path> is the path to the filesystem block special device, mount point, file or 
# a directory which is part of a filesystem.

check device rootfs with path /
    alert <%= @servermonitor %> with reminder on 480 cycles
    if space usage > <%= @space_usage %> then alert
